# hello-world

The main thing I'm hoping to get out of Web Design is just the experience and the knowledge. I originally was going to conestoga last year for programming and analysis, I ended up dropping the program since a lot of the work was setting you up for a desk/business sort of job and thats just not what I am intrested in. That program did however offer a few "intro to HTML coding" classes which I really enjoyed, I really liked the process of coding a website and watching it all come together. So currently the plan is to get a certificate in web design and kinda see where it goes from there, I'm looking at other schools currently for stuff like Video Game Design and Acting but for now I think web design is the move. Its a job title that seems to always be growing in demand and it gives me a years time to figure out what I want to do next.
